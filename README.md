# Arduino-Lighting-Automation
Lighting system using Arduino Controller programmed in C++. Pulse width modulation signal activates LED according to surrounding light level in dim environment according to photoresistor input. Pushbutton can be used to manually override the photoresistor. Smoothing algorithm using moving array gives more accurate calculation of surrounding light level.
